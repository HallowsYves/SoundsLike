## What is it? / How do I use it? 
SoundsLike is a music recommendation system that takes your natural language prompts to suggest songs you might like. It combines a specified song, artist, or mood to find new music with similar characteristics.

Simply enter a prompt, adjust the number of recommendations you want, and get new songs that sound like your input!

**Example**: *"Chill songs like Solar by Inner Wave"*
