# SOUNDSLIKE ðŸŽ¼
SoundsLike is a music recommendation system designed to suggest songs based on a user's textual input, including specific song/artist preferences and desired moods. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user queries and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as embeddings, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and K-Means clustering, to find and visualize similar songs.



## Core Features
* Natural Language Processing: Use everyday language to describe the kind of music you want. The system is designed to understand prompts like "sad songs like Moon by Kanye West."
* Accurately identifies song titles and artists from your prompt using a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model.
